Minitalk

This project pertains to establishing communication protocols between a server and a client system. 

The server operates with a designated Process ID (PID) through which the client can initiate communication and transmit strings of any length.

The pivotal aspect of this project lies in comprehending signal handling mechanisms, which facilitate the exchange of information between the server and the client.

As an additional feature, the client is empowered to transmit emojis alongside textual data. Upon successful reception of the entire message by the server, a signal is relayed back to the client, 

indicating completion, upon which the client terminates communication, acknowledging receipt with the message, "The message has been received successfully."
